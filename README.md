# MRI-IoTified

This project contains the source code of brain MRI detection on edge devices with constrained abilities. 
The model is deployed on raspberry PI devices with camera's connected to them and thus can be diagnosed without the patients being on the premises. 

The implementation code is based on Python, Flask.
